# Snowflake Mirrorer

This is a Python script using Pygame to generate pretty snowflakes from drawn input.
It supports variable size slices, mirror / rotational symmetry, and a neat spinning animation. 

This program was inspired by the Stardew Valley Discord guild's seasonal event.

## Running

Install the requirements (or just Pygame, since that's all that's needed).

`pip install requirements.txt`

You may now run the file as you wish.
